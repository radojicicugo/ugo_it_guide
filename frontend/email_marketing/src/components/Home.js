                              The expression of <strong>“cold emailing”</strong> means the practice by which an email message is sent to a target professional prospect without having had any prior contact or interaction with this person and without them having requested this contact. 😬
                              <hr></hr>
                              Cold emailing poses a problem of marketing pressure and can lead to deliverability problems when it is misused. It is often encountered in the practice of growth hacking. 😎
                              <hr></hr>
                              The term <strong>cold emailing</strong> is used by analogy with that of cold calling. It should not be confused with the more qualified approach associated with a follow-up email. 📧
                              <hr></hr>
                              In a nutshell, <strong>cold emailing</strong> is when you email someone you don’t know for no apparent reason. The goal of these emails is to establish a relationship with the prospect (potential customers) and advance them down the sales funnel. 👇

                         <div className='paragraf m-3 p-3'>
                              Consider how business connections grow in the offline world to have a better idea of what it is. Everything usually begins with a discussion… 🤗
                         </div>
                         <div className='paragraf m-3 p-3'>
                              One situation is that a salesman attends an industry conference or trade show in order to meet new clients. They hunt for opportunities to strike up a discussion throughout an event. Their goal, however, is not to sell their product or brag about their company. They aim to break the ice and begin a conversation. They want to learn more about their prospect’s company and establish a relationship with them. 🤝
                         </div>
                         <div className='paragraf m-3 p-3'>
                              The same ideas apply to outbound sales. In the internet world, a cold email is a way to initiate a discussion. It’s a message you deliver to someone who has probably never heard of your company or knows very little about it. We call them “cold” leads since this is the first time they’ve heard of you. 👂

                         <div className='paragraf m-3 p-3'>
                              The purpose of a cold email is to create a connection from strangers to business partners, not to convert them right away. To put it another way, to warm up those leads. Slowly yet steadily. 🐢

                         Your product is created for an audience that will like it. Target the most probable audience to show interest and <strong>take action</strong> in your cold email campaign. 🚀

                         You may also divide your target audience into multiple groups. E.g., IT firms, SaaS-based enterprises, and so on… CEO, Vice President, Board Member, Program Leader, Programmer, and more positions. 🧑‍🎓

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         Similarly, you may divide them by the number of team members, the size of the company, and so on. It is entirely up to you and your product how you choose to go about doing it. 👌

                         In contrast to a <strong>cold call</strong>, emailing is a <strong>tactic</strong> that requires less time from potential customers or visitors. Furthermore, because you will be sending these cold emails to potential consumers, you may customise the email content to them, resulting in a more personal relationship. 😊

                         In today’s world, a successful salesperson understands the importance of networking. Although meeting experts face to face may not always be practical, this should not prevent you from interacting. 👍

                         You may use cold email to reach out to people. You may provide a brief introduction to yourself and your organization, just like you would if you were meeting in person. If the receiver appreciates your sincere attempt, they may reach out to you and assist you in expanding your network. 🔗

                         The most significant benefit of cold emailing is that it is extremely targeted. That you’re just targeting those who are interested in your goods or service. You can contact potential customers and inform them about your product or service. 🧲

                         This leads us to the section where we discuss items to consider before sending an email. VESC is critical for ensuring that your cold email campaign (sequence) has a high deliverability rate, ensuring that your message reaches your recipient’s inbox rather than their <strong>spam</strong> folder. 😨
                    </div>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         VESC – This is the abbreviation for the checklist you’ll go through before pressing the send button. It stands for: “Validate prospect list”, “Ensure clear CTA”, “Set follow-ups (steps)”, “Check your email spam score”. 🔎

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">

                    <h3 className="naslov3 p-3 m-3">1. Validate the List of Prospects</h3>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         Begin by validating your email address list. The people you’re emailing should be comparable in some way. As previously said, you must check that all of these prospects’ addresses are correct, by using email enrichment for example. 🤑
                    </div>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         As a result, the first step in delivering a cold email campaign (sequence) is to authenticate those email addresses. Otherwise, you risk getting in trouble for sending the incorrect <strong>email to</strong> the wrong person and not getting effective results. 😪
                    </div>
                    <h3 className="naslov3 p-3 m-3">2. Ensure the CTA is obvious</h3>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         Here are some CTA <strong>(Call To Action)</strong> examples commonly used by mailers: 👇

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         When sending an email, ensure sure there is just one unambiguous call to action. You don’t want your reader to be confused by what you want them to do. 🤔

                         It’s a good idea to include a follow-up (step) in your campaign. It not only saves time, but also motivates you to work more. How? When you set an auto-follow-up (step), there are different sets of conditions. Conditions such as:

                              <li>No message sent – If you enable this condition, your email will be sent even if you haven’t talked via direct message yet.</li>

                         It is this factor that will determine whether or not the recipient will open the email. It is the receiver’s initial point of contact and should be written carefully. 👀

                         The first appears to be a standard advertising email, whereas the second piques interest through personalization. 🤩 As a result, always include a catchy subject line. If the subject line of your email grabs your recipient’s attention, they will open it.

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         2- Put the most important thing at the beginning of the introduction: maximize the chances that your email will be read by adding key information first! 🥇, the amount of a promo code, an event, a deadline, etc.
                    </div>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         3- Avoid words that are too “spammy”: these are words monitored by email providers, so be careful. Here are some examples, “promotion”, “free”, “urgent”… ❌

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         4- Consider using emojis: to make your teaser line more visible and attractive. 👀 Above all, they allow your subject line to stand out significantly more than the others in their inboxes.

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">

                         It gives you a wonderful feeling when someone you haven’t seen in a long time recalls your name. Emails are subject to the same psychology. 🤓

                    <h1 className="p-3 m-3">Step 3: The Body of the Email Should Be Short</h1>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         The human attention span is dwindling at the same rate as technological advancements are altering our everyday consuming patterns. Humans, according to some studies, now have a lower attention span than goldfish. 🐠 Keep the body of your email as brief as possible.
                    </div>
                    <h3 className='p-3 m-3'>The body of a cold email is divided into three sections:</h3>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         <ol>
                              <li>Make sure you identify yourself honestly in your introduction</li>
                              <li>Show your purpose quickly – Get right to the point.</li>
                              <li>Thank them for their time and provide a greeting with one point of contact in the salutation.</li>
                         </ol>

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         The lenght of the email should be short, consisting of no more than 2-5 sentences totaling no more than 200 words. According to research, the ideal amount of words is between 50 and 125.
                    </div>

                         Even though few individuals would read a long email from a stranger, many people still send lengthy pitches outlining their company, product, or service. That is not the path to take. Respect the time of your prospects. Keep it brief.

The text-to-HTML ratio can be messed up if the signature contains a lot of HTML. 😣 It’s better to use a basic text signature if you don’t have somebody who can examine and clean up your signature HTML. You can also use our signature generator, which has been thoroughly tested.

                              <li>Keep it brief and sweet — the CTA should be no more than one sentence long. You should be as brief as possible. It also shouldn’t be hazy.</li>
                              <li>Ask your prospect anything they can do right now.
                                   However, don’t ask for too much — a request for a basic action or a brief answer is likely to be more effective than a 30-minute phone conversation. Begin small. 🌱 Even if you finally invite your prospects to a meeting, the initial email they receive from you may not be the best place to start.</li>

                         According to the findings of a study including billions of email addresses, the ideal time to send your emails is around 10 a.m. Because that’s when the majority of emails are opened, your chances of getting read increase considerably. ⌚ If you don’t have a compelling cause, don’t send your email before this time. Never send emails around 3 or 4 a.m., since they will appear strange in the inbox of the recipient.

                         There are a few methods for completing these steps.

To identify the best emailing style, you must keep track of your results.

                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         A cold email is an unsolicited email sent as part of an email marketing campaign to introduce your brand to someone who has never heard of you or your organization before. 👋

                         This does not imply that it is spamming – although it is extremely easy to seem like spam mail, so be careful to follow the steps above. In order to avoid this mishap, we have prepared a guide with the most common mistakes! 😓

<ul>
     <li>
                                   Don’t neglect the subject line, this step might seem useless but actually it’s the very first impression that your prospect will get from you. 👎
                                   Don’t forget to personalize each one of your messages, if you forget to mention your prospect’s name from the first email, then all following communications are over! 👎
                                   Do keep it short! I cannot stress this step enough, you need to make sure that your message is clear and straightforward. Your potential customers need to know quickly if you have a solution to their problems or not. 👍
                                   Do keep it clean! Make sure you have a nice email signature, this step might seem superficial but actually this could be one of the reason why you could land into someone’s junk mail. 👍
Do keep the conversation going! Make sure to follow-up with your potential customers, do not leave them hanging. So make sure to book that demo call or send them a reminder email so you do not miss any business opportunities. 👍

                    <h1 className='p-3 m-3'>Is Cold Emailing Illegal?</h1>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         Technically NO, if you use only professional email addresses… 😮 For example, in the French context, the practice of cold email is exclusively a B2B practice which can be done on a professional email address since in this case, the law does not impose an opt-in as it does for personal addresses. However, sending cold emails to personal addresses is indeed, 🤐 illegal!
                    </div>
                    <div className="p-3 m-3">
                         Cold emailing practices are most often done on rented, purchased or “scraped” addresses for which the method of the collection is very variable. They can also be made from addresses collected by email enrichment and/or ✍️ qualified manually.
